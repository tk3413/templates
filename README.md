# taimore's templates

because life is easier when you have a solid foundation.

templates contain (at minimum):
- some structure
- some way of managing dependencies
- a unit test suite that works with the source code
- an end to end test suite that uses gherkin format and source code
- a logger and a linter
- instructions on how to export code as an independent module
